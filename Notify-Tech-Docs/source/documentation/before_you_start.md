# Before you start

To start using the GOV.UK Notify platform, you’ll need:

- a digital service that needs to send messages
- an application to integrate with the GOV.UK Notify API
- a [GOV.UK Notify account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register)
- a service team with the development skills to build the technical integration with GOV.UK Notify (refer to the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have) for more information)

Make sure you’re also familiar with the government guidance on [deploying new software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly).
