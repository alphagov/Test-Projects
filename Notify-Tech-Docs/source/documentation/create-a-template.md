## Create a template

To create a template:

Log into your GOV.UK Notify account.

Go to Templates.

Click _Add a new template_.

Select the type of template and click _continue_.

>Note that letter notifications will need to be enabled separately.

_QP: How does this happen?_

Complete the name field.

The input in the message field depends on whether the message has personalisation parameters or not.

If it does not have personalisation parameters, type "Hello world" into the message field.

If it does have personalisation parameters, fill in the content of the message, ensuring that all parameters have dobule brackets around them:

"Dear ((name))

Your licence will be posted to you on ((date))"

Further information on personalisation can be found in the [Arguments](link) section.

Select whether the message should be included in the priority queue. If you select yes, the notifications that use this template will be higher in priority than none-priority queue notifications.

Click _save_.

On the next screen, you will see your message template and a template ID. You can refer to this template at any time to get the template ID.
